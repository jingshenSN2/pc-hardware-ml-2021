I understand arm chips are smaller and have less heat and what ever. but what about legacy apps on windows? aren't they made to run on intel. yes eventually new applications can be made to run specifically for arm chips. but that's not going to happen overnight. in the case of apple, isn't this just really a ploy by them to screw over consumers? like changing from the pin connectors to charge their phones to lighting cables. getting rid of the head phone jack so that that you have to use bluetooth headphones, then coincidentally they start selling airpods that happen to bluetooth head phones. then adding fast charging capabilities to their phones. but making you have to buy the fast charger separately. their macbook pro's (the expensive ones) are already weak as it is when compared to gaming laptops running on windows. then moving to arm is going to make them weaker still. but they price is going to stay the same. or knowing them (apple) they'll probably raise the price on arm chip macbooks and tout them as more energy efficient with better battery life! all while leaving out the fact that they are less powerful. I've owned a macbook pro before. those thin ones with the touch bar. and I didn't like. to me it was like owning a over glorified chromebook . yeah the specs were beefy enough to watch youtube videos, have a lot of tabs open in chrome browser. but even with at the time, the most current gen Icore 7 processor and 16 gigs of ram. I was not blown away or even impressed with its video editing capabilities. and aside from emulators, it wasn't good at running tripple A games.

I don't see how anyone that considers themselves a tech junky would ever buy a macbook. for all they are really good for/ checking email/browsing the web or looking youtube netflix or hulu. you're better off saving money and buying a really nice chromebook for like 5 or 6 hundred dollars. and saving your money. that's what I did. I use my Hp omen for gaming and video editing. and I use my Hp chromebooks with an 8 gen icore 3 and 8 gigs of ram for light stuff. and I think I still had a little money leftover from the macbook",

Most of you don't care about amd or intel, all you see is an underdog story where the underdog is victorious over the big dog, and you all swoon over those, so hopping on the amd fanboy train was obvious. If amd beats intel, then I'd sort the fanboys into two groups. The first group is more loyal to amd and will do a 180 and start swooning over the big dog, and the second group will abandon amd for the next underdog. And if that new underdog starts to rival amd, then the two groups will end up arguing exactly like amd and intel fanboys are now.\n\nSo in the end, both sides are hypocrites, one for doing a full 180 and swooning over the big dog, and the other for completely abandoning the company they worship once they became the most successful.\n\nThat is, of course, if intel falls out of the cpu game in a big way, either they come out with new chips and remain the market leader (which you fanboys couldn't have) or they and amd become more equal rivals in terms of sales and performance (which a whole lot of you fanboys also wouldn't want for some reason).\n\nOf course, this all comes down to one major point: Fanboys suck, they aren't thinking logically, they're just blindly following their instincts of \"Us good, Them bad\". One that is thinking logically would understand that these are still two companies, and right now amd has the upper hand. They also understand that it's very likely intel will regain the upper hand in the near future simply as them becoming more competitive to deal with amd.\n\nBut fanboys aren't logical, and they're holding us back as a species.",
            "textOriginal": "Way too many people love underdog stories and will quickly jump onto the fanboy train to crap all over what they've considered to be the prefered processors for decades.\n\nAMD had had a few good years and good for them, but intel will no doubt come back around with superior processors shortly (in production cycle terms that might be a several years but still) and take back their advantage.\n\nAnd you fanboys, guess what... Most of you don't care about amd or intel, all you see is an underdog story where the underdog is victorious over the big dog, and you all swoon over those, so hopping on the amd fanboy train was obvious. If amd beats intel, then I'd sort the fanboys into two groups.
