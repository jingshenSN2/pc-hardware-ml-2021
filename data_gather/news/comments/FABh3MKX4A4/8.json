I'm curious what a Noctua themed build would look like, it's not impossible for one to exist, Asus themselves have released motherboards in the past with whole-board covers for aesthetic reasons. Pair that with this GPU, and other Noctua products, and all that's missing is a proper case, RAM, and a PSU with themed cables to match. I wouldn't be surprised if a modder accomplishes this relatively quickly if a product lineup doesn't exist. \n\nIf the W11 is anything like the preview build, TPM isn't something to worry about. There's known workarounds, such as unpacking the installer, changing a line of code, and repacking as an ISO; this probably exists for OEMs with specific platforms that may not require it, such as low-level kiosks that act nothing more than a menu or ordering platform, if not a direct variant of W11 existing in this way, without the TPM requirement, for low-level applications. Not that TPM is really the solution, as it's also not secure, so I'm not really sure why Microsoft is making it a requirement, the decision just looks arrogant at best. \n\nI hope the Xbox nightmode comes to PC. My one complaint about PC gaming with a controller is that stupidly bright logo, there's absolutely no reason for it to be as bright as it is. The only comparative brightness on any other lit product I own is the fully exposed LEDS on my keyboard for num, caps, and scroll lock, and luckily my num lock's LED has burnt in since I've bought the keyboard. Another issue with the light on the controller is that it's white, it's pretty harsh in the middle of the night.\nOn a related topic, I hope future controllers start including RGBW LEDs, just so that the light can match the rest of a setup, or even tuned to match the theme of the specific controller you have.",
