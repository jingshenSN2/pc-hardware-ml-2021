Games back in the early 2000s on pcs often times didn't have this or they had glitchy bugs built into the disk (fallout tactics) that you simply couldn't get a fix for. Heck some games back then even screwed up your machine when they installed forcing you to reinstall your OS and try again. After steam came a long and they started curating games they also started forcing developers to use their installation systems to avoid installation errors and so games could be patched then they forced them to start making sure it could save games to both steam cloud and a local directory. I finally could game and not worry about some system glitch or update or installation error and losing my saves. I try and see both sides of this narrative 30% is a lot but I don't want to go back to those days where we had major issues just even installing a game. Remember games that required windows live activation? Ugh it was terrible no thanks ill stick to the steam store. Also I'm not giving up my workshop mods so sorry microsoft store / epic figure it out !!!!!",
