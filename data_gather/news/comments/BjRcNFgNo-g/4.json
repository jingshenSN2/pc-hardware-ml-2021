If a compressed tank of hydrogen is pierced the extremely high pressure forms a dense jet that compresses the air in front of it(remember air is mostly nitrogen not oxygen) mixing inefficiently. This means in the absolute worse case a large jet of flame is created in a single direction, but oxygen can not enter the tank until pressure drops to one atmosphere (15psi) at which point there is a insufficient hydrogen to oxygen ratio available to produce a fuel air explosion. In most situations any small source of ignition(sparks,hot surface, small flames) would be extinguished by the high pressure hydrogen displacing the air. This combined with the fact that hydrogen is a incredibly light element means that it will take less than a minute to clear the accident zone going straight up. Added to this compared to just any other fuel being transport every day like gasoline, diesel, and LPG. Even burning hydrogen does effectively no damage to the environment. Unlike even a simple spill of other fuels let alone a significant fire. The issues with the hindenburg was it was a massive volume of hydrogen at atmospheric pressure perfect conditions to mix efficiently with air. In flammable cloth bags coated in even more flammable sealing compound inside a flammable cloth envelope also coated in even more flammable doping(flexible paint). All on a lightweight aluminum structure with extremely limited resistance to losing structural integrity under extreme heat before also catching on fire. The hindenburg also as most large aircraft do developed a extremely high static electricity charge on external surfaces during long flights. The much vaulted german engineering expertise was mostly the result of massive funding by the german government, and truly obscene level of propaganda also by the german government. Other than the work done in the USA by Wernher von Braun's team it is difficult to find groundbreaking achievements by German engineers. They exist, but the german school of engineering  places a far higher value on improving existing technology instead of developing new technology.

I don't know what is total number of 3000-series GPUs sold, but I imagine this is going to be not insignificant part of it. If people can be angry on bots and scalpers, then why not crypto miners?
